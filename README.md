# House-price-prediction-

**Irish house price prediction**, a data-driven project which focuses initially on exploring the dependent features with the independent feature which is the price. The features such as location, size, bath, balcony, total square feet, and energy ratings, affect the price of the property in Ireland. The project involves exploring the initial insights of the data set using statistical functions, seaborn-based graphs. Followed by exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, building the classification and regression machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, lasso regression, random forest regressor, support vector machine, XG boost regressor, and gradient descent regressor. Finally, hyper parameter tuning is performed such as cross-validation and GridSearch CV to enhance the model performance.
